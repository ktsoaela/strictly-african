and create your own user in the db like this

The error you're encountering:

```
FATAL: Tenant or user not found
```

indicates that the PostgreSQL user you're trying to connect with (`postgres.yoursupabas-session-pooler-user`) does not exist in the database.

Since you're using Supabase's session pooler, you'll need to ensure that the user (`postgres.yoursupabas-session-pooler-user`) is created in Supabase, as this error usually occurs when the database cannot find the specified user.

### Steps to Create the User in PostgreSQL (Supabase):

1. **Connect to your Supabase PostgreSQL instance** using the connection string format that works (as youâ€™ve already verified):
   ```bash
   psql postgresql://postgres.yoursupabas-session-pooler-user:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```

   This will connect you to the database with the specified user and password.

2. **Create the User in PostgreSQL**:
   Once you're connected to the database, run the following SQL commands to create the user and grant the necessary permissions.

   ```sql
   -- Create the user
   CREATE USER "postgres.yoursupabas-session-pooler-user" WITH PASSWORD '[PASSWORD]';

   -- Grant the user access to the 'postgres' database (or any other database you're using)
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE postgres TO "postgres.yoursupabas-session-pooler-user";

   -- Optional: Grant the user permissions for all tables in the schema
   -- Make sure you're connected to the correct schema (usually 'public' in Supabase)
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "postgres.yoursupabas-session-pooler-user";
   
   -- Grant the user permission for future tables in the schema
   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO "postgres.yoursupabas-session-pooler-user";
   ```

3. **Verify the User Creation**:
   You can check if the user was created and has the appropriate permissions by running:
   
   ```sql
   \du  -- This will list all users and their roles.
   ```

4. **Try Connecting Again**:
   After creating the user and granting the necessary privileges, try connecting to the database again via Laravel. The error should no longer occur if everything is set up correctly.

If you only want to run a specific service separately from your **Docker Compose** setup, you can use the following command:  

### **Running a Single Service**  
```sh
docker compose up <service_name>
```
For example, to run only your **Laravel** service, use:  
```sh
docker compose up laravel
```
Or for **Next.js**:  
```sh
docker compose up nextjs
```
Or just the **PostgreSQL database**:  
```sh
docker compose up db
```

---

### **Running a Service in Detached Mode**  
If you want to run it in the background (without logs filling your terminal), add the `-d` flag:  
```sh
docker compose up -d laravel
```

---

### **Stopping a Running Service**  
To stop just one service, run:  
```sh
docker compose stop <service_name>
```
Example:  
```sh
docker compose stop laravel
```

---

### **Restarting a Service**  
```sh
docker compose restart <service_name>
```

---

### **Rebuilding a Service (If Changes Were Made)**  
If you've changed your `Dockerfile` or dependencies, rebuild before running:  
```sh
docker compose up --build laravel
```

---

### **Checking Logs for a Specific Service**  
```sh
docker compose logs -f <service_name>
```
Example:  
```sh
docker compose logs -f laravel
```

To prune Docker and remove unused data, you can use several commands depending on what you want to clean up. Here's a breakdown of the most common pruning commands:

### 1. **Prune Unused Containers, Networks, Volumes, and Images**
This command will remove **all unused containers, networks, volumes, and images** that are not currently being used by any running container.

```bash
docker system prune
```

- It will ask for confirmation before deleting unused data. You can skip the confirmation by adding the `-f` flag:

```bash
docker system prune -f
```

### 2. **Prune Only Stopped Containers**
If you just want to remove stopped containers (containers that are not running), you can use:

```bash
docker container prune
```

This will remove all stopped containers. Again, use `-f` to skip the confirmation prompt:

```bash
docker container prune -f
```

### 3. **Prune Unused Volumes**
To remove unused volumes that are not attached to any containers:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

Again, skip the confirmation prompt with:

```bash
docker volume prune -f
```

### 4. **Prune Unused Networks**
If you want to remove unused networks:

```bash
docker network prune
```

To skip the prompt:

```bash
docker network prune -f
```

### 5. **Prune Unused Images**
If you want to remove unused images (dangling images or untagged images):

```bash
docker image prune
```

To remove **all unused images** (not just dangling images), use the `-a` flag:

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

### 6. **Prune All Docker Resources (Containers, Volumes, Networks, Images)**
If you want to remove **all unused resources** (containers, volumes, networks, and images) in one go:

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

### Summary:
- `docker system prune` â€“ Removes unused containers, networks, and dangling images.
- `docker container prune` â€“ Removes stopped containers.
- `docker volume prune` â€“ Removes unused volumes.
- `docker network prune` â€“ Removes unused networks.
- `docker image prune -a` â€“ Removes all unused images.

Make sure you understand that these commands will **permanently delete unused data**, so use them with caution.
