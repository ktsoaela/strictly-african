## 1. **PostgreSQL Container Fails to Start: Port 5432 Already in Use**

If your PostgreSQL container (`strictly-african-db-1`) fails to start with the error:

```
Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint strictly-african-db-1
```

This typically occurs because **port 5432 is already in use** by another PostgreSQL instance on your host machine.

### **Solution**

#### **Step 1: Identify Whatâ€™s Using Port 5432**
Run the following command to check which process is using port 5432:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :5432
```

Youâ€™ll see output like this:

```
COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
postgres  1234  postgres  7u  IPv4  12345  0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:5432 (LISTEN)
```

If PostgreSQL is already running, you have two options:

---

#### **Option 1: Stop the Local PostgreSQL Service**
If you donâ€™t need the system-wide PostgreSQL service, stop it:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```

To prevent it from starting on reboot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable postgresql
```

Then restart your Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose up
```

---

#### **Option 2: Change the Port in `docker-compose.yml`**
If you need both the system PostgreSQL **and** the Docker container running, change the exposed port in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Find this section:

```yaml
ports:
  - "5432:5432"
```

Change it to another port, like `5433`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "5433:5432"
```

Then restart Docker:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

---

#### **Step 2: Verify the Containers Are Running**
After fixing the issue, verify if the containers are up:

```bash
docker ps
```

This should now show your database container running properly.

---

## 2. **Next.js App Successfully Built**

If your Next.js app has been successfully built, you can start the production server using:

```bash
npm run start
```

Or, if you're using Docker, restart the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d nextjs-1
```

Then, visit **http://localhost:3000** to check if everything is running smoothly. ðŸš€

## 3. **Apache "Forbidden" Error**

The "Forbidden" error indicates that Apache is running but doesnâ€™t have permission to access the resources itâ€™s supposed to serve, or there might be a configuration issue.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**

#### **Step 1: Check File Permissions**
Ensure the files in your Laravel application have the correct permissions so Apache can read and serve them.

Run the following commands inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it strictly-african-laravel-1 bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/storage /var/www/html/bootstrap/cache
```

This ensures proper permissions for the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories.

---

#### **Step 2: Check Apache Configuration**
The error could be due to a misconfiguration in Apache. Check the Apache logs for more details:

```bash
docker exec -it strictly-african-laravel-1 bash
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```

Look for specific error messages related to permissions or misconfigurations.

---

#### **Step 3: Verify Laravel `.env` Configuration**
Ensure the `APP_URL` in your `.env` file matches the URL youâ€™re accessing (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`):

```plaintext
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

---

#### **Step 4: Check Apache Virtual Host**
Ensure the Apache virtual host configuration is correct. Verify the `DocumentRoot` in the default configuration:

```bash
docker exec -it strictly-african-laravel-1 bash
cat /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

Ensure the `DocumentRoot` points to `/var/www/html/public` (the default Laravel public directory).

---

#### **Step 5: Clear Laravel Cache**
Clear Laravelâ€™s cache to resolve potential issues with cached routes or configurations:

```bash
docker exec -it strictly-african-laravel-1 bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

---

#### **Step 6: Restart Apache**
After making changes, restart Apache inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it strictly-african-laravel-1 bash
service apache2 restart
```

---

#### **Step 7: Check Apache Access Logs**
Check the Apache access logs for further clues:

```bash
docker exec -it strictly-african-laravel-1 bash
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

---

### **Conclusion**
- Ensure proper file permissions for Laravelâ€™s directories, especially `storage` and `bootstrap/cache`.
- Verify Apache and Laravel configurations.
- Restart Apache and clear Laravelâ€™s cache.

The error you're encountering is due to port `5432` (which is typically used by PostgreSQL) already being in use on your system. This is preventing Docker from binding the port for your container (`strictly-african-db-1`).

### Solutions:

1. **Check if PostgreSQL is running on your machine:**
   First, verify if you have a local PostgreSQL instance running thatâ€™s using port `5432`. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :5432
   ```

   If you see that the port is in use, you can either stop the local PostgreSQL service or change the port in your Docker configuration.

2. **Stop the local PostgreSQL service:**
   If PostgreSQL is running locally, you can stop it (if it's not essential) using:

   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql stop
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're using `systemctl` to manage PostgreSQL, use:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop postgresql
   ```

3. **Change the port for the database container:**
   If you need to keep your local PostgreSQL running and canâ€™t stop it, you can modify the port binding in your `docker-compose.yml` (if you're using Docker Compose) or your Docker run command.

   If using **Docker Compose**, you can modify the port mapping for the database service:

   ```yaml
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres
       ports:
         - "5433:5432"  # Change 5432 to another port like 5433
   ```

   This will bind PostgreSQL to port `5433` inside the container and port `5433` on your host machine instead of port `5432`.

4. **Restart your Docker containers:**
   Once the port issue is resolved (either by freeing up port `5432` or by changing the port mapping), you can restart your containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **If youâ€™re not using Docker Compose**, and running the container manually, update the `-p` argument to reflect a different port:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5433:5432 your-image-name
   ```

This should resolve the port conflict issue you're seeing.


The error you're encountering indicates that **Next.js** can't resolve the package `tailwindcss-animate` in your project during the build process.

Hereâ€™s how you can resolve the error:

### 1. **Install `tailwindcss-animate` Dependency**
It looks like you might not have installed the `tailwindcss-animate` package, or the installation didn't succeed. Try installing it manually by running:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss-animate
```

### 2. **Check for Correct Import**
Make sure you're importing `tailwindcss-animate` correctly in your CSS file (typically in `globals.css` or wherever you're using it). For example, ensure you have the correct configuration in your `globals.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss-animate";
```

### 3. **Check Tailwind CSS Configuration**
Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` is properly set up to support the plugin. You need to add the `tailwindcss-animate` plugin in the `plugins` section. For example:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-animate'),
  ],
}
```

This configuration ensures that `tailwindcss-animate` is used as part of your Tailwind CSS build.

### 4. **Clear npm Cache and Rebuild**
Sometimes, clearing the npm cache and rebuilding can resolve issues caused by incomplete or corrupted installs.

Clear the npm cache with:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

Then delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock` if using Yarn):

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

After that, reinstall the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run the build again:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. **Double-Check File Path**
If the error persists, ensure that the file path in the error message (`/usr/src/app/src/app`) is correct, and there are no issues with how the project is structured in your container. If you have recently moved files around or made changes to the folder structure, update any relevant paths.

### Conclusion
To fix this error, ensure that the `tailwindcss-animate` package is installed, properly configured in the `tailwind.config.js`, and that the `globals.css` file correctly imports the plugin.
